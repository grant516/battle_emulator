# Overview

This software performs a simple Pokemon battle emulator. It does this by pulling information from a json file and using a third-party header file to make it usable for C++. From here, we take the information in the json file and create both a enemy and player character. The user is asked what they would like to do with options presented to them. The battle is over when the player or enemy's character looses all of their HP.

I created this software to help me learn C++. I took a C++ course while attending college, but didn't feel I was gaining the understanding that I desired. Because of this, I built this program to help deepen my understanding of the C++ language.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Future Changes

This software is far from where I would like it to be. I would like to incoperate the Pokemon type chart, in other words, adding weaknesses and resistances. I would also like to add proper typings to their movesets. Those are the next steps I would like to take, but I may include more after those changes.
